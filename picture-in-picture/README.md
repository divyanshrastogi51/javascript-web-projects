# Picture in Picture

This is an app that will allow you to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable, resizable, window that will stay on top of anything you do. So you can have a tutorial video in the corner of your screen while you are working on something in the background.

- Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- using MediaStream API
- using PictureInPicture API 


Both API are inbulit WEBAPI :). They can be found [at](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)


Fact- Just 10 lines of JS and Hurray you just made a screen sharing function similar of google meet or Zoom.
